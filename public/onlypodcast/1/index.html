<p>This isn't Don's site. Well, it is, but a different Don Denton. One who... hosts... trivia? As of today, it hasn't been <em>actually</em> updated in about 6 or 7 years. At least there is a helpful link to DonDentonActor.com at the bottom.</p>

<p>This is the guy who wrote <em>Bloodstains in Paradise</em>. The Paul Foreman who co-wrote the music for <em>Disco Jesus and the Apostles of Funk</em> is a different Paul Foreman. He's not <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Foreman">this Paul Foreman</a>, either.</p>
